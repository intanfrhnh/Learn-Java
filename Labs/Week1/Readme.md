# Question 1 - HelloWorld.java

For your first Java exercise you are going to design the most simple 
of programs, one which you are likely to encounter when you learn other 
programming languages. The purpose of the program is to print out some 
text to the console, more precisely the phrase “Hello World”, followed 
by a new line.

# Question 2 - PersonalGreeting.java

The aim of this exercise is to expand on your original program by allowing
simple interaction with a user. The sequence is as follows:

1. The user provides their first and last names as command line arguments when 
running the program.
2. The user is then greeted by their full name.

# Question 3 - Adder.java

The aim of this exercise is to introduce you to some very simple numeric calculations, 
and the parsing of input data. The task is to create a program called Adder that takes 
two numbers from the user, sums them and displays the calculated value.

# Question 4 - Multiplier.java
This question is similar to the previous question, but in this task you should calculate 
the product of three numbers.

Write a program that takes three integers as command line inputs, and calculates their 
product. You should print out the equation you are evaluating, as well as the final output.
